The project "A Novel TF-IDF Weighting Scheme for Effective Ranking" focuses on developing an improved term frequency-inverse document frequency 
(TF-IDF) weighting method to enhance document ranking in information retrieval systems. This new TF-IDF scheme aims to provide more accurate relevance 
scoring by refining how term importance is calculated based on their frequency in individual documents and across a collection. The enhanced weighting 
mechanism seeks to improve search results by prioritizing documents that are more relevant to user queries, leading to better precision and recall in 
information retrieval tasks.
